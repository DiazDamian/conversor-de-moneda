Author Diaz Damian
this is a small proyect made for practice purpose for a alura programing course
variables and functions encountered in the program are in spanish. is noticed that english naming conventions are best practice but was ommited because the curse is in spanish it was not considered to relevan.
the idea of the program was to make a local currecy from the country of who make the program and convert it in a foreign currency. also learn how to make a windows program using the class JOption
the program is saparated in the "main" class and the "ControladorDeVentanas" (windows controller) class leaving the "main" class for execution only and the "ControladorDeVentanas" for the logic.
